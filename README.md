# Sorting Algorithms Benchmark
## Algorithms
1.	Insertion-sort
2.	Binary Insertion-sort
3.	Merge-sort
4.	Quick sort (pivot is always selected as the first element)
5.	Quick-sort with median-of-three pivot selection
6.	Heapsort
7.	Counting sort
## Results
- Some algorithms have the same asymptotic bounds, but speeds are different.
- Most of time, input range and run time inversely proportional for the same input size.
- For small input sizes performance of all algorithms nearly the same.
- Quick Sort (Median-of-three) is the most efficient and fast algorithm in most cases.
